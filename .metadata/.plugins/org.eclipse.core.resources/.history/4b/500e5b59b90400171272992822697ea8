 * Shape assumes a bounding box defined by its opposing corners. In contrast, TextView
is defined by an origin, height, and width. Shape also defines a CreateManipulator
operation for creating a Manipulator object, which knows how to animate a shape
when the user manipulates it.1 TextView has no equivalent operation. The class
TextShape is an adapter between these different interfaces.
